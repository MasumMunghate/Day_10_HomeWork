This code is wrapped in an event listener that waits for the HTML content to be fully loaded (DOMContentLoaded). This ensures that the JavaScript code doesn't run until the webpage's structure is ready.

The code gets a reference to an HTML button with the ID "colorButton".

When the "colorButton" is clicked, a function is executed. This function generates a random color using another function called generateRandomColor().

The generateRandomColor() function uses a set of characters (digits and letters) to build a random color code in hexadecimal format (like "#FFFFFF" for white). It loops six times to create a six-character color code.

Inside the loop, it randomly selects characters from the defined set of characters and adds them to the color code being built.

Once the loop finishes, the generated color code is returned.

Back in the main function, the random color generated by generateRandomColor() is used to change the background color of the entire webpage (document.body.style.backgroundColor).
